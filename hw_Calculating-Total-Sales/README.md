## (Calculating Total Sales) 
# A mail order house sells five different products whose retail prices are: 
 + product 1 — $ 2.98, 
 + product 2—$ 4.50, 
 + product 3—$ 9.98, 
 + product 4—$ 4.49 and 
 + product 5— $ 6.87. 

Write a program that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows: 
a) product number 
b) quantity sold 
 + Your program should use a switch statement to determine the retail price for each product. 
 + Your program should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold. 
 + Use a sentinel-controlled loop to determine when the program should stop looping and display the final results.
